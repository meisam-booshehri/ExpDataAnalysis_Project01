#----------- This file has been produced by Meisam Booshehri--------------
# ----------Steps for running the codes are as follows

1- Copy the "plot1.R", "plot2.R", "plot3.R", "plot4.R" into the working Directory
2- load the files into R 
3- call one of these functions: "plot1()", "plot2()", "plot3()", "plot4()" . Upon calling one of  the functions, the dataset will be downloaded from coursera, then it will be stored in a sub-directory namely "meisam.booshehri.repo". Then the zip file will be extracted in this directory for the next calls. This process is done only for the first time.
4-After calling the desired functions the corresponding plot will be stored in the working directory
